"""Candidate implementation goes here.

Implement ``evaluate_offer`` so that it satisfies the rules in ASSIGNMENT.md and
the example expectations in tests/test_cases.py. The dataclasses below define the
required OUTPUT shape (see ASSIGNMENT.md "Output"). You may add helpers, modules,
or rewrite internals freely, but keep ``evaluate_offer``'s signature and the
serialized shape of ``Result`` (so the runner and tests work).
